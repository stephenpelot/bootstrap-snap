 Tomorrow is called the feast of Crispin. He that outlives this day will stand at tip-toe when this day is named, and rouse him at the name of Crispian. He that shall see this day and live old age will yearly, on the vigil, feast his neighbors and say "To-morrow is Saint Crispin's." Then shall he strip his sleeve, and show his scars and say "These wounds I had on Crispin's."
